# Image-Generator
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview This project is a text-to-image generation system that uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic images based on natural language descriptions provided by the user. The system asks the user to describe the image they want, and then automatically creates a high-quality image using AI.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python â€“ Core language

Stable Diffusion â€“ AI model for generating images from text prompts

Hugging Face diffusers â€“ For easy access to pretrained models

PyTorch â€“ Backend for model inference

Google Colab â€“ For free GPU acceleration and interactive interface

IPython Display â€“ To show generated images directly in the notebook

ðŸš€ How It Works
User Input â€“ The user is prompted to describe an image in plain English.

Image Generation â€“ The Stable Diffusion model processes the description and generates a realistic image.

Display Output â€“ The generated image is shown directly in the Colab notebook.

ðŸ§ª Example
Prompt:
a man wearing a black suit standing in front of a skyscraper

Output:
A high-resolution image of a man in a suit, with the background matching the description.

âœ… Features
Text-based image generation with no need for training

Lightweight code that runs in Google Colab

No need to upload or store image datasets

Works with creative, descriptive prompts
